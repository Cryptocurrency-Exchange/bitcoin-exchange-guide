# About This Repository

This repository serves as an educational resource focused on explaining how modern Bitcoin exchange systems operate. It explores non-custodial swaps, privacy-focused exchange methods, no-KYC conversion paths, and cross-chain asset routing techniques.

The goal is to provide clear, neutral documentation that helps users and developers understand how private exchange processes work without acting as a commercial service or financial platform.
